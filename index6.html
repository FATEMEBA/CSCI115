                <td>Fear and Suspense: The primary objective of horror movies is to invoke fear and suspense in the
                    audience. They utilize various techniques, such as atmospheric tension, jump scares, startling sound
                    effects, and unexpected plot twists, to create a sense of dread and anticipation.

                    Supernatural or Paranormal Elements: Many horror movies incorporate supernatural or paranormal
                    elements into their narratives. These can include ghosts, demons, vampires, zombies, haunted houses,
                    or otherworldly creatures. The presence of these supernatural entities heightens the sense of fear
                    and the unknown.

                    Psychological Horror: Psychological horror movies focus on the psychological and emotional aspects
                    of fear. They explore themes such as mental instability, psychological trauma, mind games, and the
                    breakdown of the human psyche. These films often rely on atmospheric tension, suspenseful
                    storytelling, and psychological twists to unsettle the audience.

                    it's important to note that not all horror movies rely heavily on gore, and there are subgenres that
                    focus more on psychological or atmospheric horror rather than explicit violence.
